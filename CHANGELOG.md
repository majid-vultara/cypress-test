## [5.0.0] - 2022-02-08

## [2.0.0] - 2020-10-17

### Changed

-   Use `workflow_dispatch` instead of opening an issue as the initial trigger of the release.
    Not only is this more convenient to use, it also fixes a security vulnerability that may have allowed users without write access to execute arbitrary code within the context of the repositories GitHub action.
-   Merge `master` in `dev` after a release branch is merged.
    Previously, we used to merge the `release` branch back into `dev`.
    However, this caused some issues because the actual merge commit was not present in the `dev` branch.
    It also prevented use of the "automatically delete head branch" feature of GitHub which works well together with the "PR retargeting" feature.

## [1.4.0] - 2020-02-22

### Added

-   A whitelist of which users can trigger the release workflow.

## [1.3.0] - 2020-02-22

### Added

-   Automatically close the release issue after the release branch was merged.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-02-17

### Changed

-   Don't request reviews from pull request author for merging release branch back into dev.
    The author of the PR is github-actions[bot], we can request a review from them.
-   Don't make a separate commit for updating the version of package.json

## [1.1.0] - 2020-02-17

### Added

-   GitHub action to backport releases to dev branch

### Fixed

-   Merge commit is used to tag release instead of last commit on release branch

## [1.0.0] - 2020-02-15

### Added

-   Everything since the beginning!
